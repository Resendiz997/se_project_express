# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Tech stack and tools

The stck used for this project include : 
~ MongoDB, as our database  
~ Postman, to test, debug, and document our API.

Switching over to the back-end side of our WTWR project a couplel diffrent tools where used to crate this back-end. Starting off with the set up of ESLint in the Airbnb style, allowing us to maintain clean, consistant, and easy to understand code. Using Mongoos as our priamry database collection for our items. The introduction of schemas an dpassign them properly to create the validation as well as error handleing . 


## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
